# CAIP-2

*For context, see the [CAIP-2][] specification.*

## Rationale

In CAIP-2 a general blockchain identification scheme is defined. This is the
implementation of CAIP-2 for Solana. Blockchains in the "solana" namespace are
validated by their genesis hash; each blockchain is maintained by a
"[Cluster][]" of nodes, with its own gossip entrypoint and other endpoints.
These genesis hashes require no transformations to be used as conformant CAIP-2
references aside from concatenating their first 32 characters.

## Syntax

The namespace "solana" refers to the Solana open-source blockchain platform.

### Reference Definition

The definition for this namespace will use the `genesisHash` as an identifier
for different Solana chains. The method for calculating the chain ID is as
follows with pseudo-code:

```
truncate(genesisHash, 32)
```

### Resolution Method

To resolve a blockchain reference for the Solana namespace, make a JSON-RPC
request to the [RPC Endpoints][] of a blockchain node with method
`getGenesisHash`, for example:

```jsonc
// Request
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "getGenesisHash"
}

// Response
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdpKuc147dw2N9d"
}
```

The response will return as a value for the result a hash for the block with
height 0 that should be truncated to its first 32 characters to be CAIP-30
compatible.

### Backwards Compatibility
