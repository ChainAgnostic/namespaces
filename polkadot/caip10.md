# CAIP-10

*For context, see the [CAIP-10][] specification.*

## Rationale

Polkadot addresses can be expressed a number of ways, but the default form is a
base58 [multiaddress][] with a human-readable prefix of one or more characters.
The specification defining these across the entire Polkadot namespace is
[SS58][]; this specification summarizes the calculation of an address as
`base58encode ( concat ( <address-type>, <address>, <checksum> ) )`, where
`<address-type>` is a prefix registered in the [SS58 registry][] and where
`<checksum>` options are constrained by targeted output-length.

While the above describes a given keypair as generating many addresses per
network, a 47-character multiaddress is the default expression, unique per
chain.  Note that a single private key will thus produce different
multiaddresses on each chain where it is used, so de-duplicating accounts in a
multi-Polkadot context requires implementing full support for advanced SS58
functions.

As the default multi-address was used to express individual addresses in
CAIP-10, other possible expressions are out of scope of this specification.
Similarly, recovery of chain ID from account type or validation of addresses
using the included checksum are out of scope, although both are specified in
[SS58][].

## Syntax

As the default/standard expression of an address in Polkadot is a 47-character
base58 string, the following regular expression can be used for validating
addresses:

```
[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{0,47}
```

### Cross-Namespace  Compatibility

In conformance with CAIP-10, a `chainID` can be explicitly specified for closer equivalence to other CAIP-10 applications in other namespaces.  However, `chainID` is derivable from any valid address using [SS58][], so a special case of addresses for which the encoding context does not have available (i.e. has not yet derived) the `chainID` from an address, or where the consuming software/party is expecting to derive it regardless, is proposed.  In these cases, the literal `ss58` can be used in the place of a `chainID`.

## Test Cases

This is a list of examples composed using the [polkadot.subscan tool][]:

```
# Kusama
//example address from [Polkadot-ENS tutorial][]:
polkadot:b0a8d493285c2df73290dfb7e61f870f:CpjsLDC1JFyrhm3ftC9Gs4QoyrkHKhZKtK7YqGTRFtTafgp

//one address in multiple network-specific expressions, taken from the [Polkadot address explainer][]:

# Underlying Public Key:
0x54a0lf789elcflcf69da4010f7001dfaea8e4166656f332ebb5b38ec85704811

# Kusama (coordination chain; address-type prefix 0)
polkadot:b0a8d493285c2df73290dfb7e61f870f:EVH78gP5ATklKjHonVpxM8c1W6rWPKn5cAS14fXn4Ry5NxK
polkadot:ss58:EVH78gP5ATklKjHonVpxM8c1W6rWPKn5cAS14fXn4Ry5NxK

# Edgeware (address-type prefix 7)

# Kulupu (address-type prefix 16)
polkadot:742a2ca70c2fda6cee4f8df98d64c4c6:jRaQ6PPzcqNnckcLStwqrTjEvpKnJUP2Jw65Ut36LQQUycd
