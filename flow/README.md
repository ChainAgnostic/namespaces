# Namespace for Flow

Flow is a layer-1 blockchain focused on scalable smart contracts and consumer applications.
This namespace documents how Flow networks are identified for CAIP use cases.

## Rationale

Flow networks are distinguished by stable, human-readable network names.
A clear CAIP-2 profile makes these networks unambiguous across wallets, dapps, and tooling.

## Governance

Flow protocol changes are governed by the Flow community and its core development process.
Network identifiers in this namespace are expected to remain stable for each network.
