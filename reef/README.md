# Namespace Reef chains

## Introduction

Reef is a modular layer 1 blockchain for DeFi, NFTs and gaming. It is built with Substrate modules, has EVM support and uses Nominated Proof of Stake consensus. 
Despite some tooling in common (such as [SS58][]-based per-chain addresses), direct interaction with Polkadot nodes, contracts, or wallets according to the standards of the Polkadot namespace is not currently possible.

## Syntax

The namespace "reef" refers to the Reef open-source blockchain platform.
