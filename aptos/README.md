# Namespace for Aptos chains

## Introduction

Blockchains in the "aptos" namespace are identified by their numeric `chain_id`;
each network is maintained by a set of validators with its own REST API and
indexer endpoints. Aptos is a Layer 1 blockchain built on Move, featuring
parallel execution via Block-STM for high throughput.

## Syntax

The namespace "aptos" refers to the Aptos open-source blockchain platform.
