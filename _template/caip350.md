## Chain reference

### Text representation

<!-- a description of the format of chain namespace + reference intended for the text representation of ERC-7930 Interoperable Addresses -->
<!-- MUST include how to represent the ChainType without a reference, since that is supported by [ERC-7930] -->

##### Text representation -> CAIP-2 conversion

<!-- instructions for how to convert from the above to a CAIP-2 string -->

##### CAIP-2 - text representation conversion

<!-- instructions for how to convert from a CAIP-2 string to the Interoperable Address format -->

#### Binary representation

<!-- description of how will chain references be laid out in binary Interoperable Addresses' `ChainReference` field -->

#### Text -> binary conversion

<!-- instructions for converting from the text representation to the binary one -->

#### Binary -> text conversion

<!-- instructions for converting from the text representation to the binary one -->

#### Examples

## Addresses

### Text representation

<!-- a description of the format of addresses intended for the text representation of ERC-7930 Interoperable Addresses -->

##### Text representation -> customary text address formats conversion

<!-- instructions for how to convert from the above to the address formats normally used in the ecosystem -->
<!-- MUST cover all address types used in the ecosystem -->

##### customary text addresses -> text representation conversion

<!-- instructions for how to convert from text address normally used in the ecosystem to the Interoperable Address format -->
<!-- MUST cover all address types used in the ecosystem -->

#### Binary representation

<!-- description of how will addresses be laid out in binary Interoperable Addresses' `Address` field -->

#### Text -> binary conversion

<!-- instructions for converting from the text representation to the binary one -->

#### Binary -> text conversion

<!-- instructions for converting from the text representation to the binary one -->

#### Examples

## Extra considerations

<!-- Anything that is particular to this namespace and of interest to users, such as not being able to satisfy canonicity requirements -->
