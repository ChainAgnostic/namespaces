# CAIP-19

*For context, see the [CAIP-19][] specification.*

## Rationale

On Stacks, there are three types of native assets: STX, fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens. STX tokens are exposed to the users,
the two others are only internal to smart contracts defined by the programming language Clarity. A Stacks smart contract can define 
more than one native fungible or non-fungible token to allow detailed control over assets.

Smart contracts that contain only one fungible token, resp. one non-fungible token defines a Stacks fungible token (FT), 
resp. a Stacks non-fungible token (NFT). There are corresponding standards (SIP) exposing token functions to the user.


## Syntax

After the [CAIP-2][] (namespace+chainID), a slash defines an `asset_namespace` and an `asset_reference`. 
The `asset_namespace` is defined via the SIP  or

| ft         |               | SC defining one native fungible token but not following sip10 standard |
