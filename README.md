# Namespaces
Chain Agnostic Namespaces (CANs) describe a blockchain ecosystem or set of ecosystems as a namespace, relying as much as possible on the [CAIP](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs) specifications to minimize the research needed to interact with assets, contracts, and accounts in that namespace.

# Contributing

 1. Review [CAIP-92](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/92/files).
 2. Fork the repository.
 3. Add your CAIP to your fork of the repository. There [will soon be] a template CAN here.
 4. Submit a Pull Request to Chain Agnostics's [`namespaces` repository](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/namespaces).

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final CAN, with all applicable CAIPs addressed. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new CAN and assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a `discussions-to` header with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the CAN as a whole.

If your CAN requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that CAN as follows: `assets/namespace-N` (where **N** is to be replaced with the CAN name). When linking to an image in the CAN, use relative links such as `../assets/namespace-{N}/image.png`.

# CAN Status Terms

* **Draft** - an CAN that is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.
* **Last Call** - an CAN that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wide audience.
* **Accepted** - a core CAN that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author.
