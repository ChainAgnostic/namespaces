# Namespace for SWIFT Networks chains

This document describes the syntax and structure of the [SWIFT][] namespace, which encompasses many legacy and novel standards for international asset transfers and transactions.

## Introduction

SWIFT names a consortium of 11,000 financial institutions worldwide that use a number of digital networks to compliantly transfer assets internationally.
The organization's purview covers many messaging and reporting systems, as well as multiple data models for assets.
