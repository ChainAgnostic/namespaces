# CAIP-19

*For context, see the [CAIP-19][] specification.*

## Rationale

A common data model was needed to represent fiat balances in multichain networks, and rather than invent an arbitrary new one, using SWIFT/ISO notation seemed more forward-compatible.
As no SWIFT namespace was yet defined, an "empty" one with a special-case for off-network/out-of-band usage, "chainId 0", was added and ISO 4217 codes were used for internationally-recognized fiat currencies and notations.

## Syntax

The fiat currency standard used across most modern SWIFT tooling and accounting systems is ISO 4217, which assigns a 3-letter code to each national currency on Earth, as well as a few supranational ones (`EUR` for the Euro), and a special category, all prefixed with `X`, for major rare metals.
The 3-letter codes are here capitalized, following the legacy convention.

The template for validating these namespace is as follows:
```
chain_id:    "swift:" + network_id + "/iso4217:" + currencycode
network_id:  0 for off-network usage or TBD for specific SWIFT networks
currencycode:   [A-Z]{3}
```

Other asset standards (such as the [ISO 15022] standard for securities accounting or the more verbose [ISO 20022] data model for assets) may be specified at a later time, pending community interest.

## Test Cases

```
# Euro (â‚¬)
swift:0/iso4217:EUR

# US Dollar ($)
swift:0/iso4217:USD

# Argentine Peso ($)
swift:0/iso4217:ARS

```
