# Namespace for {non-technical name for ecosystem or family of chains}

Qubic is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain that offers instant finality, feeless transactions, and rapid smart contract execution.
It distinguishes itself by integrating Useful Proof of Work (UPoW), transforming mining energy into artificial intelligence computations, thereby laying the groundwork for decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

## Governance

Qubic employs a quorum-based system with 676 nodes, termed Computors, responsible for executing smart contracts and securing the network.
A quorum of at least 451 Computors is required for consensus on major decisions, ensuring decentralized governance.
