# Namespace for Cosmos chains

This document describes the syntax and structure of the [Cosmos][] namespace,
which formalized a URI scheme for references on the broader Cosmos ecosystem.
This ecosystem includes many different kinds of blockchains, variously
interoperable and interconnected, but share the consensus rules and
[configuration objects][] of the Tendermint consensus engine.  The namespace
thus defined includes blockchains generated using the [Cosmos
SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) such as Cosmoshub, Binance, and the
Cosmos Testnets, but also [Weave](https://github.com/iov-one/weave)-based
blockchains, like IOV.  These blockchains can have drastically different
properties and capabilities, but have certain interoperability commitments
imposed by the shared SDK and use the message-based Inter-Blockchain
Communication Protocoal (IBC) to communicate and move assets between them along
"[channels][]".

## References

- [ChainID tips][] : A useful thread on chainIDs on the Cosmos SDK github repo
- [IOV Core TS][] : A reference implementation of the CAIP-2 section of this specification in the IOV Core SDK
- [configuration objects][] : Tendermint core requires each chain have a unit
      genesis block and genesis block timestamp, and derives a chain ID
      (`chain_id` in their semantics) deterministically from those values; these
- [IBC][] : The Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol is used to enable bridges and multi-chain compatibility between Tendermint chains
- [channels][] : The Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol establishes
      persistent "channels" between the clients of independent Cosmos-based
      blockchains; these can maintain state for assets across two chains like a
      bridged asset or smart contract.
- [ICS][] : The InterChain Standards are canonically maintained in this repo, and
      cover all aspects of interop and addressing between/across Cosmos chains
      and networks; these are equivalent to BIPs, EIPs, and CAIPs.
- [IBC#517][] : A GitHub thread containing a concise explanation of `chain_id` validation/constraints across Cosmos contexts
