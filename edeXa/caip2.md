## Simple Summary

This document is about the details of the edeXa namespace and reference for CAIP-2.

## Abstract

In CAIP-2 a general blockchain identification scheme is defined. This is the
implementation of CAIP-2 for edeXa.

## Motivation

See CAIP-2.

## Specification

The JSON-RPC provider is able to make one or more JSON-RPC requests accompanied
by a [CAIP-2][] compatible `chainId`

### Resolution Method

To resolve a blockchain reference for the EIP155 namespace, make a JSON-RPC
request to a blockchain node with method `eth_chainId`, for example:

```
// Request
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_chainId",
  "params": []
}
// Response
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "result": "0x7cb"
}
```

The response will return a base-16-encoded integer that should be converted to
base 10 to format an EIP155-compatible blockchain reference.
