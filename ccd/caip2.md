# CAIP-2

*For context, see the [CAIP-2][] specification.*

<!-- Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CAIP.-->

This CAIP defines an identification schema for Concordium networks.
The Concordium networks are identified by the `ccd` namespace prefix, followed by a truncated hash of the given network's genesis block.

## Rationale
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
Concordium has one mainnet and potentially several testnets.
These networks are uniquely identified by a hash of their genesis blocks.

## Syntax

<!-- Explain the actual algorithm or transformation needed to transform inputs into a
conformant and unique CAIP deterministically.  Consider including a regular
expression for validation as well, as some consumers or toolmakers may want to
support this CAIP without a deep understanding of any specifications, devdocs,
or improvement proposals on which this specification depends. -->

Concordium's network ID is a hash of its genesis block in hexadecimal encoding, truncated to the first 32 characters.

<!-- TODO: add some details, e.g. something like pseudocode `truncate(SHA512(block_data), 32)` -->

### Resolution Mechanics

A hash of the genesis block can be obtained using the gRPC interface of a Concordium node (see [Concordium gRPC][]).
The [GetConsensusInfo][] command provides data which includes the hash of that network's genesis block, which can be truncated to serve as the network identifier.

The request using a CLI tool [concordium-client][] looks as follows:

```
concordium-client raw GetConsensusInfo
```

Example response for the `testnet` node:

Truncating the value of the `genesisBlock` attribute to the first 32 characters gives `4221332d34e1694168c2a0c0b3fd0f27`

<!-- Many blockchain systems allow for transactions, asset-states, etc. to be
validated against the chain they are targeting or depending to to avoid replay
attacks or other unintended outcomes. This is often done by an API or RPC call
to a node to validate the targetted chain or network. Include a sample
request/response and add the relevant documentation to the `## References`
section below if possible, as well as an explanation of any steps needed to
validate the results, calculate checksums, etc. -->
