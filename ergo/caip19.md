## Rationale

Ergo supports custom tokens as first-class citizens as outlined in [EIP-0004].

A transaction can create tokens from thin air in its outputs if the Asset ID matches the ID of the transaction's first input ([box]). 
Since the box identifier is cryptographically unique, it's impossible to have a second asset with the same identifier. 
This rule also implies that only one new asset can be created per transaction.

The ID format for fungible (ERC20-equivalent) and non-fungible (ERC-721 equivalent) tokens is the same.
The process for issuance of either is also the same.
The only difference is that NFTs must have specific values for certain properties.

## Specification of Asset ID

Asset ID is a 32 byte array encoded as a hex string. 
When issued, it is equal to the ID of the transaction's first input that issued this asset.

## Syntax

The syntax of Ergo Asset ID:

```
address:    namespace + ":" chainId + ":" + reference
namespace:  ergo
chain ID:   32-character prefix from the hash of the genesis block
reference:  Ergo Asset ID represented as hex string
```
